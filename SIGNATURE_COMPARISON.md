# React Native Signature Components Comparison

This React Native application provides a comprehensive comparison of different signature capture implementations, showcasing three distinct approaches to handling digital signatures on mobile devices.

## 🎯 Overview

The app features three signature implementations:

1. **React Native Signature Canvas** - WebView-based solution
2. **React Native Signature Capture** - Native implementation
3. **Custom Signature Component** - SVG-based solution with Gesture Handler

## 📱 Features

### Home Screen
- Clean interface with navigation to test different signature components
- Visual indicators for each implementation type
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices

### Signature Canvas (react-native-signature-canvas)
- **Technology**: WebView-based with HTML5 Canvas
- **Features**: 
  - Undo/Redo functionality
  - Clear signature option
  - Customizable styling via CSS
  - Base64 image output
- **Best for**: Web-like signature experience, complex styling needs

### Signature Capture (react-native-signature-capture)
- **Technology**: Native bridge implementation
- **Features**:
  - Direct native performance
  - File system image saving
  - Configurable stroke properties
  - Portrait/landscape modes
- **Best for**: Performance-critical applications, file-based workflows

### Custom Signature Component
- **Technology**: React Native SVG + Gesture Handler + Reanimated
- **Features**:
  - Pure React Native implementation
  - Smooth Bezier curves
  - Real-time path generation
  - SVG path data output
  - Fully customizable
- **Best for**: Maximum control, custom requirements, no external dependencies

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React Native**: 0.80.0
- **React Navigation**: Stack navigation
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **React Native Gesture Handler**: Touch handling
- **React Native Reanimated**: Smooth animations
- **React Native SVG**: Vector graphics

   ```

## 📊 Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Signature Canvas | Signature Capture | Custom Component |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Performance | Medium (WebView) | High (Native) | High (Native) |
| Customization | High (CSS) | Medium | Very High |
| File Output | Base64 | File Path | SVG Path |
| Dependencies | WebView | Native Bridge | Gesture Handler |
| Platform Support | iOS/Android | iOS/Android | iOS/Android |
| Bundle Size Impact | Medium | Small | Small |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Custom Signature Algorithm
The custom component uses quadratic Bezier curves to create smooth signature lines:
- Captures touch points via Gesture Handler
- Generates control points for smooth curves
- Renders real-time SVG paths
- Outputs standard SVG path data

### Navigation Structure
- Stack Navigator with typed routes
- Custom header styling per screen
- Gesture handler integration

## 📝 Usage Examples

Each screen provides interactive examples showing:
- How to capture signatures
- How to clear/reset signatures
- How to handle signature data output
- Performance characteristics
